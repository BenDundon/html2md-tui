# HTML to Markdown TUI

A simple wrapper around [Johannes Kaufmann's html-to-markdown library](https://github.com/JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown) utilising [Charm Bracelet's Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubblete) for TUI elements.

## Inspiration

Google's Keep Takeout files are, for some god-forsaken reason, exported as HTML. I found that there was no real way to nicely convert HTML to MD from the terminal, so I made one.

## Restrictions

Currently, this is only a TUI program. It is unable to just take input and give output, so it can't be used in scripts.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)
